# some ideas
App should have a title (can be 'random' written in random order) and different random utils. Most important ones should be:
    - Flipping a coin. 
        - Coin rendering and animation can be hard. Maybe finding some other bool values (yes or no?).
        - Would be nice for it to be 'shuffling' until tapped onto?
    - Choosing a number between 1 and n.
    - Choosing a random value from a list of values.
    - Group values into groups of n.

After each random case you should be able to try again, remove selected value from items (if applies), modify values, maybe add assertions (e.g. when making pairs, a and b cannot form a pair.)

App feel:
    - Setting the values or random cases needs to be as fast as possible and animations need to be satisfying (you can't just pop the random value onto the screen) but fast so as not to waste time.
    - Settings for each random util should take the whole screen instead of configuring the process.
    - Should also support light mode? Depending on the device, it should avoid having a settings screen.

Users should be able to keep track of their defined lists of values:
    - GREAT USE CASE: User can add a list of restaurants and pick one at random, discarding it after but keeping track of all the restaurants they have gone to.
